# Wireshark Packet Capture Lab - Task 5

## ðŸ§  Objective
To capture live internet traffic and identify some basic network protocols like HTTP, DNS, and TCP.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used
- Wireshark (free packet capturing tool)

## âœ… Steps Followed
1. Installed and opened Wireshark on the computer.
2. Started capturing packets on the active network interface.
3. Opened a website and used the `ping` command to generate traffic.
4. Waited for about a minute, then stopped the capture.
5. Applied filters such as `http`, `dns`, and `tcp` to view specific packet types.
6. Identified at least 3 protocols: **HTTP**, **DNS**, and **TCP**.
7. Saved the capture as a `.pcap` file.
8. Wrote a short summary of observations from the captured data.

## ðŸ“˜ Outcome
- Learned how to capture and inspect network packets using Wireshark.
- Understood how different protocols appear and behave during online activity.
- Gained practical hands-on experience in basic network analysis.
